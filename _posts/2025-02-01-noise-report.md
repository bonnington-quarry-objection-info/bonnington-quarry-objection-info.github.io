## Critical Analysis of Bonnington Mains Quarry Noise Report and Objections Guidance

This post provides a critical analysis of the noise report for the proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry, identifies potential breaches of planning policies, and offers guidance for residents who wish to write objection letters.

### Critical Analysis of the Noise Report

The noise assessment for the Bonnington Mains Quarry expansion uses modeling and baseline surveys to predict noise impacts at sensitive receptors. The assessment relies on **BS 5228-1: 2009+A1-2014** and **Planning Advice Note (PAN) 50, Annex A** for guidance. The report also references **British Standard 8233:2014** and the **World Health Organization (WHO) “Guidelines for Community Noise”**. Baseline noise levels were established in September 2023, with measurements taken at several locations, including:

*   Old Smiddy (Clifton Cottage)
*   Bonnington Mains Farmhouse
*   Cala Homes Craigpark Housing Development
*   Ratho Mains Farm

Key findings of the noise report include:

*   **Compliance with Existing Limits:** The report states that predicted noise levels generally comply with the existing noise limits of planning consent **22/02514/FUL** and the limits suggested in PAN 50 Annex A.
*   **Temporary Operations:** During temporary operations, such as soil stripping, the noise limit is set at 70dB LAeq over any one hour period for a maximum of 8 weeks per year. The predicted levels for soil stripping are below this limit.
*   **Acoustic Barriers:** The report mentions the use of acoustic barriers/bunds as a mitigation measure.
*   **Cumulative Effects:** The report considers cumulative noise effects from the quarry and the Lost Shore Surf Resort and concludes that they remain within acceptable limits.

However, there are several points that need critical assessment:

*   **"Quieter Rural Area" Limits:** The report notes that the existing planning consents are based on PAN 50 criteria recommended for **"quieter rural areas"**. Given the level of development in the area, the report suggests that a noise limit of **55dB LAeq,1h** should be applied as a daytime noise limit at all sensitive properties. This shift from the "quieter rural area" designation is a crucial point that could be challenged, as the area is arguably not a "quieter rural area."
*   **Worst-Case Predictions:** Although the report claims that levels are within limits, the assessment is based on predicted worst-case scenarios, which may not always be the reality. The report does not fully address the range of noise that residents may experience.
*  **Subjective Experience:** The report does not fully account for the subjective experience of noise and its potential for annoyance. While levels might technically be within limits, the character, timing, and duration of the noise could still cause disruption and distress.
*  **Night-time Operations:** The report mentions night-time operations and sets a limit of NR25 for the asphalt plant. However, there are no specific predictions given for noise levels at night at sensitive receptors, and the potential impact on sleep is not addressed in detail.
*   **Monitoring:** The report states that details of noise measuring and monitoring records are to be recorded and submitted to the Planning Authority on a quarterly basis. This may be insufficient if issues occur more frequently, and the monitoring is not readily available to local residents.
*   **Limited Scope of Consultation:** Although the applicant has consulted with the City of Edinburgh Council, it is important to verify that consultation with local residents has been genuine and that their views have been considered thoroughly.
*   **Reliance on Modeling:** Noise predictions are based on modeling, which has inherent uncertainties. The report should include an explanation of these uncertainties and how they have been addressed.

### Potential Breaches of NPF4 and City Plan 2030

Based on the noise report and the wider documentation, there are potential breaches of **NPF4** and **City Plan 2030**:

*   **NPF4 Policy 12 (Zero Waste) & 33 (Minerals):** These policies require that developments demonstrate no significant adverse impacts on nearby homes, communities, and sensitive receptors and that environmental impacts, including noise, are acceptable. If the local community experiences disruption from noise, especially during evenings, nights, and weekends, this would be a breach of NPF4.
    * The noise assessment notes that the existing planning consent limits are based on a "quieter rural area", and that new limits should be applied due to development in the area. The report does not justify the increase of the limit, and thus this potentially demonstrates that the development has not demonstrated that there are no adverse impacts to nearby homes, communities and receptors.
*   **City Plan 2030 Policy Env 33 (Amenity) and Policy Env 34 (Pollution):** These policies state that developments will be supported where the amenity of neighboring properties is acceptable in relation to noise and that developments should not cause significant adverse effects on the environment, including noise. If noise levels are found to be disruptive, excessive, and not in keeping with local expectations, this would be a breach of the City Plan.

### Guidance for Residents' Objection Letters

Residents can use the following points when writing objection letters, referencing potential breaches of NPF4 and City Plan 2030:

*   **Specific Noise Concerns:** Clearly articulate specific concerns regarding noise, including:
    *   The *type* of noise (e.g., blasting, machinery, haulage).
    *   The *timing* of noise (e.g., early mornings, evenings, nights).
    *   The *duration* of noise (e.g., continuous, intermittent).
    *   The *frequency* of noise (e.g., regular, occasional).
    *   The impact on *sleep and daily activities*.
*   **Challenge "Quieter Rural Area" Designation:** Emphasize that the area is not a "quieter rural area" and that a higher noise limit may not be appropriate. Highlight the proximity of housing developments and other sensitive locations.
*   **Question "Worst-Case" Scenario:** Point out that noise predictions are based on worst-case scenarios and that the reality may be different. Request clarity on a range of noise levels and not just the worst-case.
*   **Subjective Impact:** Note the subjective impact of noise, including the potential for annoyance, stress, and disruption to daily life. Emphasize that just because levels are technically within limits does not mean they are acceptable.
*   **Night-time Noise:** Raise concerns about the lack of detailed assessment of night-time operations and their impact on sleep.
*   **Cumulative Effects:** If relevant, emphasize the cumulative effects of noise from the quarry and other sources, such as the surf resort.
*   **Monitoring and Enforcement:** Express concerns about the monitoring and enforcement of noise limits. Request that monitoring data should be made readily available to the community.
*   **Breach of NPF4 and City Plan Policies:**
    *   State that the proposal fails to demonstrate no significant adverse impact, as per **NPF4 Policy 12 and 33**.
    *   Argue that the proposal breaches **City Plan 2030 Policy Env 33 and 34** by not maintaining an acceptable amenity regarding noise.
*   **Request for Independent Assessment:** Request that the planning authority commission an independent noise assessment to verify the findings of the applicant's report, particularly around the change from "quieter rural area" and the proposed limits, and the potential for night-time disruption.
*  **Prior Non-Compliance:** Refer to Breedon's history of non-compliance and appeals, raising concerns about their commitment to responsible operations and adherence to planning conditions.

### Additional Considerations

*   **Agent of Change Principle:** NPF4 indicates that the "agent of change principle applies to noise sensitive development". Therefore, if any new development is built in proximity to the quarry, it will be the responsibility of the new development to adapt to the noise levels of the quarry.
*   **Health Impact:** Although "human health can be scoped-out of the EIA as a standalone assessment topic", the impact on health via noise, stress, sleep disruption can be brought to the attention of the planning authority.
*  **The noise levels experienced at the boundaries of the nearest receptors are not referenced, and the specific levels mentioned in the report do not mention where those measurements are taken, therefore this is something that could be investigated.**

By using these points, local residents can craft strong objection letters that highlight the potential breaches of planning policy and emphasize the potential negative impacts of the quarry expansion.
