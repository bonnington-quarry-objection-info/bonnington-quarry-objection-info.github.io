## Bonnington Mains Quarry Expansion: Increased Traffic 

The proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry raises several important questions about traffic impact, policy compliance, and community well-being. This post analyzes these aspects and provides suggestions for local residents who wish to object to the development.

## Traffic Impact Analysis

The expansion is predicted to bring a notable increase in heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic to the surrounding road network [1, 2]. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

*   **HGV Movements:** The development could generate up to **175 two-way HGV movements per day** [2]. While this is below a previous "peak" scenario, it still represents a substantial number of large vehicles [2].
*   **Road Network:** The main roads affected are the B7030, M8, and M9 [2]. The B7030 is a single carriageway, while the M8 and M9 are dual carriageways. Most HGVs are expected to use the M8 [2].
*   **Traffic Flow Increases:** The development is expected to increase total traffic by **2% and HGV traffic by 13% on the B7030** [2]. The M8 and M9 will see smaller increases in total traffic (around 1%), with HGV traffic increases between 2% and 5% [2].
*   **Thresholds:**  A full traffic assessment is not required based on IEMA guidelines because the increases are less than 30% (or 10% in sensitive areas) for total traffic, and less than 30% for HGV traffic.  However, this threshold approach may be questioned [2].
*   **Existing Traffic:** The traffic assessment removed 199 existing quarry trips from the baseline data before adding 350 two-way trips, meaning only 151 "new" trips were added. However, for the M8 and M9, all 350 were included [2].
*   **Cumulative Impact**: The City Plan 2030 requires cumulative transport impacts to be addressed.  The EIA report treats the development as effectively a new development, not an extension to an existing quarry [2].
*   **Mitigation**: Existing access arrangements will be retained to direct traffic north on the B7030. No other mitigation measures are proposed [2].

## Potential Policy Infringements

Several policies within the National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4) and City Plan 2030 could be seen as infringed upon by this development [3].

### National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4)

*   **Policy 1:** Requires consideration of climate and nature crises [4]. While the report concludes that the traffic impacts are not significant, it should be demonstrated that all impacts have been minimized [4].
*   **Policy 13:** Supports development aligned with sustainable travel and investment hierarchies [5].  The development relies on HGV transport, with little discussion about making this more sustainable. Developments should not increase reliance on private car use [5].
*    **Policy 33:**  Requires proposals to minimize transport impacts through the number and length of lorry trips and use rail or water transport where practical [6]. There is no consideration of alternative transport methods [6].

### City Plan 2030

*   **Policy Inf 3 and Inf 4:** Requires cumulative and cross-boundary transport impacts to be addressed. Developments should only proceed if sufficient infrastructure is available [7, 8]. The assessment does not properly consider cumulative impacts from other developments [7, 9].
*   **Policy Inf 4**: Indicates that proposals which generate significant traffic shall demonstrate that any required transport infrastructure has been addressed where relevant to the proposal [7].
*  **Policy Env 33 (Amenity):** Supports development where the amenity of neighboring properties is acceptable in relation to, inter alia, traffic. There is no assessment of amenity impacts relating to increased noise and traffic [10].
*   **Policy Inf 20**: The policy supports mineral extraction but relies on other policies for protection [11]. A significant impact on transport could impact this policy [11].
*    **Policy 14**: Development is not supported where it would prejudice proposed new transport infrastructure and junction improvements. [12]

## Road Traffic Accidents

*   **Accident Data:** Over the past five years (2018-2022), there have been two accidents (one slight and one serious) near the access junction with the B7030. Another slight accident occurred on the B7030 between the access and Newbridge Industrial Estate.  There were five slight and two serious accidents in the industrial estate to the north.  Many more accidents occurred on the M8 and M9, but with no clusters that require specific consideration [2].
*   **Comparison:** The sources do not provide data to compare these accident rates with the national average [2].

## Suggestions for Resident Objection Letters

Local residents can use the following points in their objection letters to the City of Edinburgh Council [1, 13, 14]:

1.  **Traffic Volume and Safety:**
    *   Emphasize the **increase in HGV traffic on the B7030**, highlighting the potential danger to pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users [2].
    *   Express concern about the **suitability of the single carriageway B7030** to handle a significant increase in heavy vehicle traffic [2].
    *   Request a **full cumulative traffic impact assessment**, considering all developments in the area [2].
    *   Request traffic surveys that include **noise monitoring** [2].
2.  **Policy Infringements:**
    *   Highlight the development's **reliance on HGV transport**, contradicting the principles of sustainable transport and reduced car use [5, 6].
    *   Argue that the development **does not align with NPF4's emphasis on minimizing environmental impacts** and promoting sustainable travel [4, 5].
    *   Point out the **lack of consideration for alternative transport methods**, such as rail or water transport [6].
    *   Challenge the **validity of the traffic assessment** that treats the development as a new project instead of an extension to an existing site, failing to consider cumulative impacts [2].
    *   State that the proposed development goes against the principles of **sustainable transport, active travel and 20 minute neighbourhoods**  as set out in City Plan 2030 [15-17].
3.  **Amenity and Quality of Life:**
    *   Express concern about the **impact of increased traffic noise** on the amenity of nearby properties [10].
    *   Highlight that the **development will lead to increased pollution** and emissions [2, 10].
4.  **Safety Concerns:**
    *  Request information about the **suitability of the current access to manage the increased number of HGVs**, especially in light of the accident history of the area [2].
    *   Ask for a **detailed road safety audit** of the proposed arrangements [2].
5.  **Environmental Concerns:**
    *   Raise concerns about the **cumulative impact on the local environment** of this and other similar developments [2].
    *   Request information about **mitigation measures** to reduce noise, dust and vibrations, as well as water runoff [18].
    *   Highlight any potential impact on **protected species and habitats** [19].
6. **Consultation:**
    *   Highlight any perceived lack of engagement with the community and a need for further dialogue [20, 21].
    *   State that more than a 2 week extension is needed on the consultation period [13].
    *   Highlight the need for a **full and transparent assessment** of all issues raised by the community [21-23].
7.  **Lack of Detail**:
    *   State the **lack of detail on matters** such as: mitigation, transport plans, water drainage proposals, flood risk assessment, visual impact assessments, and how the proposals will affect nearby properties [1, 13, 24-28].
8.  **Precedent**:
    * Highlight the potential of this development to **set a precedent** for similar proposals that could have a long-term and cumulative impact on the area [2].

## Conclusion

The proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry raises several legitimate concerns regarding traffic, policy, and community impact. Local residents have a right to make their voices heard through the planning process, and using the points in this blog post, they can craft compelling objection letters to the council. By addressing the relevant policy points, and raising appropriate concerns, local residents can make sure their voices are heard, and the development is fully and properly assessed.
