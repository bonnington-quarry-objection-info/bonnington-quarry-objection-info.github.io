## Dust Assessment, Wind Data, and Policy Compliance Analysis



This analysis examines the dust assessment report for the Bonnington Mains Quarry, considering wind data, and identifies potential policy infringements and breaches based on the City Plan 2030 and National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4).



### Dust Assessment and Wind Data Analysis



*   **Methodology:** The dust assessment uses a **source-pathway-receptor (S-P-R) approach**. It identifies dust sources, evaluates dust travel (pathway), and assesses the impact on sensitive locations (receptors). A matrix is used to evaluate dust risk and magnitude. [1]

*   **Meteorological Data:** Wind speed and direction data from Gogarbank, about 4.5km east of the quarry, over a 10-year period, was used. WeatherNet deemed this data representative of the conditions at Bonnington Mains Quarry. [2]

*   **Wind Analysis:** The highest potential for dust dispersal is on dry, windy days. The risk of dust deposition is determined by the frequency of dry winds blowing from a dust-generating activity.  Dust is unlikely to blow on days when rainfall is above 0.2mm. The data was analyzed to find the number of dry working days with wind in a particular sector. [2]

*   **Wind Direction Frequencies:** The highest wind frequencies are from the West South West (18.4%), West (12.4%), and East North East (10.3%). Winds below 5.6 ms-1 are unlikely to carry dust. [2]

*   **Dry Windy Working Days:** The analysis shows the highest number of dry, windy working days with winds from the West Southwest. [2]

*   **Dust Control Measures:** The report details industry best practices, including **water sprays, minimizing drop heights, and covering stockpiles**. A dust event requires fine material, sufficient wind, and a failure of dust control. [1]



### Critique of the Dust Report



*   **Subjectivity:** The report acknowledges that individual complaints about dust are subjective. This highlights a need to consider qualitative factors in addition to quantitative data.

*   **Limited Quantitative Analysis:** The assessment relies on **qualitative assessments** (small, medium, or large emissions), rather than quantitative modeling, stating that quantitative modeling is inappropriate in most cases. [1]

*   **Reliance on Industry Standards:** The report heavily relies on industry best practices, and effectiveness of these measures may vary and should be monitored. [1]

*   **Air Quality Data:**  Air quality data from 2018 was used, and more recent data may be available. The assessment recognizes the influence of global emissions and local traffic.

*   **Cumulative Impacts:** The report states that cumulative dust impacts are negligible, but this may be a more complex issue that requires more detailed assessment. [1]

*   **Monitoring:** The report outlines visual inspections and a complaints log, but **lacks details on specific dust level monitoring**. [1]



### Possible Policy Infringements and Breaches



*   **National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4):** [3]

  *   **Policy 1:** Requires consideration of climate and nature crises. Effective dust mitigation is essential to minimize impact on air quality and the climate. [4]

  *   **Policy 33:** Supports mineral extraction but requires protection of communities and the environment. The dust assessment concludes that impacts should be negligible, if this is not the case there may be a policy breach.

  *    **Policy 12**: Promotes development consistent with the waste hierarchy, management of waste and dust from the recycling plant must adhere to the policy. [5]



*   **City Plan 2030:** [6]

  *   **Policy Env 33 (Amenity):** Supports development where amenity is acceptable. The dust report concludes that dust effects will be negligible but failure to achieve this would be a breach. [7]

  *   **Policy Env 34:** Relates to pollution and air, water and soil quality,  dust levels must be below criteria levels and will require monitoring and mitigation. [7]

  *   **Policy Inf 20 (Minerals):** Supports mineral extraction but relies on other policies for protection, therefore, a breach in dust levels would impact this policy. [8]

  *   **Policy Inf 18:** Supports waste management as long as there is no significant adverse impact on residential amenity or the environment, and is reliant on effective dust mitigation. [8]



### Additional Considerations



*   **Cumulative Effects:** Consider the cumulative impact of dust from all operations, including extraction, recycling, and transportation.

*   **Monitoring:** Implement regular and transparent dust level monitoring to ensure compliance and address concerns.

*   **Community Engagement:** Engage with the community to address concerns and maintain a complaints log that is actively investigated.



### Conclusion



The dust report offers a detailed assessment using best practices, however, **more specific quantitative analysis and monitoring could be beneficial**. Effective implementation of all mitigation measures is essential to prevent policy breaches. The development must also adhere to the waste hierarchy in its operations, and manage waste appropriately.
