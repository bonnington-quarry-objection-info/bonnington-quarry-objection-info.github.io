## Critique of Bonnington Mains Quarry Vibration Assessment

The vibration assessment for the proposed Bonnington Mains Quarry extension concludes that the development can operate without causing damage or significant nuisance from blasting, provided mitigation measures are implemented. The assessment uses a site-specific regression analysis and predicts that with techniques such as ‘decking’ blast holes, vibration levels at nearby receptors will comply with existing planning limits and guidelines. However, a closer look reveals some shortcomings in the approach, assumptions, and conclusions of the assessment.

### Summary of the Vibration Assessment

The vibration assessment for the Bonnington Mains Quarry expansion focuses on the potential impact of blast-induced ground vibration. It includes:

*   **Blast Monitoring:** The assessment uses data from a production blast monitored at the existing quarry in February 2023, along with data from a 2018 monitoring exercise [1]. This data is used to derive a site-specific relationship between ground vibration and distance from the blast [2].
*   **Prediction and Control:** The assessment relies on a scaling approach using separation distances and instantaneous charge weights to predict peak particle velocity (PPV) [2]. It also references the use of ‘decking’ blast holes as a mitigation measure to reduce vibration levels [3, 4].
*   **Compliance:** The assessment aims to demonstrate compliance with existing planning conditions for the quarry, which limit ground vibration to 6 mm/s in 95% of blasts over any 6 month period, with no individual blast exceeding 12 mm/s at vibration-sensitive buildings [5, 6].
*   **Mitigation:** The report details various measures to minimize vibration and air overpressure including limiting the use of detonating cord, using appropriate stemming material, inspecting boreholes, and adjusting blast designs based on local weaknesses in the strata [7, 8].
*   **Receptor Analysis:** The assessment considers vibration levels at several nearby properties including Bonnington Mains Lodge, No. 8 Bonnington, the gas main / Major Accident Hazard Pipeline (MAHP), Park Ranger Lodge, and Ratho Mains Farm [9, 9, 9-11].
*   **Cumulative Effects:** The report states that cumulative effects are unlikely as the nearest consented surface working, Hillwood Quarry, is 1.5 km to the north and operates under similar vibration limits [12, 13].

### Critique of the Vibration Assessment

Despite the seemingly comprehensive approach, the vibration assessment has several inadequacies:

*   **Limited Baseline Data:** The assessment relies on a limited amount of monitoring data, primarily from one production blast in 2023, and one in 2018 [1, 14]. While it is noted that routine monitoring is undertaken, this data isn't fully integrated into the analysis [1]. The assessment states that "results from these additional two sources have been used in the vibration analysis" but doesn't provide information on when those blasts took place, or show any specific results [1]. This limited data may not accurately capture the variability in ground conditions, blast designs, or weather conditions and how these variables impact vibration levels at the site.
*   **Regression Analysis:** While the assessment uses a site-specific regression analysis, the report doesn't show the regression analysis. It claims that this would be updated as monitoring takes place in future but this makes the regression analysis impossible to verify, and therefore difficult to fully trust [15]. The use of a regression analysis also assumes that future blasts will be comparable to those included in the analysis, but this might not always be the case, and no method is given to re-evaluate the regression if blasting conditions change.
*   **Air Overpressure:** The report notes that “demonstration of compliance with any specific air overpressure limit is not a practical possibility” [16]. Although the report details measures to minimize air overpressure, it **does not provide an assessment of the likely impact** of air overpressure at local properties which it acknowledges can cause human perception issues [16, 17]. It states that sensible ground vibration limitations will keep air overpressures to reasonable levels, but this is not fully demonstrated or proven. The report also mentions that Breedon appealed a decision by the council to retain an air overpressure limit and therefore this could be a contentious issue in future [17].
*   **Subjectivity of Perception:** The report acknowledges that human perception of vibration is subjective and can cause nuisance even at levels below those that could cause damage [17]. The report states that a goal of limiting vibration to 6mms-1 is designed to avoid even cosmetic damage [18] but it does not provide a methodology to measure or mitigate for human perception of vibration and what levels of perception might cause nuisance.
*  **Gas Pipeline:** The assessment states that the predicted level at the gas main will be 51.9 mms-1 and that this is comfortably below the permitted limit of 25 mms-1 for utilities [5, 19]. The assessment states that mitigation to reduce vibration at Bonnington Mains Lodge will also reduce vibration at the gas mains [19] . **The assessment does not offer a full and thorough analysis of the safety of the gas pipeline** and a more detailed, stand-alone assessment of this potential risk is likely required before any blasting can be considered acceptable.
*   **Cumulative Effects:** The assessment states that there are no other significant sources of vibration, and that Hillwood Quarry is distant enough not to cause cumulative effects [12, 13]. This **ignores the potential for cumulative impacts from other construction activities**, such as the ongoing construction of the Lost Shore Surf Resort, or other blasting operations which might be started in the future.
*   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The assessment states that by using blast mitigation measures in the form of double and triple decking, the ground vibration levels would comply with PAN50 guidelines and those of the existing planning permission [3]. The assessment also states that “a programme of blast monitoring should be implemented” [12], but it **does not specify the frequency or intensity of monitoring required, nor does it provide a mechanism for modifying or improving mitigation measures** if monitoring indicates that the mitigation is insufficient.
*  **Monitoring:** The assessment states that monitoring results would be used with historical site-specific results to update regression line calculations, but **does not provide a plan for what this monitoring would look like, or how that information would be used to modify blast designs** [15]. The report also states that if a complaint is received a monitoring location will be set up at the location the complaint originated from, but does not indicate what thresholds or levels would be deemed acceptable to address the complaint [20].

### Potential Policy Violations

The vibration assessment may violate several policies in the City Plan 2030 and the National Planning Framework 4:

*   **City Plan 2030:**
    *   **Policy Env 33 - Amenity:** This policy requires that development does not have significant effects on amenity [21]. While the assessment concludes vibration levels would meet planning limits, it **does not fully address the subjective nature of vibration perception** and the potential for nuisance, thereby potentially violating this policy.
    *  **Policy 34 - Pollution and Air, Water and Soil Quality:** This policy seeks to ensure that developments do not have significant effects on amenity, which includes vibration [22]. By not properly assessing the potential impact of air overpressure and cumulative vibration, the development might not comply with this policy.
*   **National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4):**
    *   **Policy 33 d) iv):** This policy requires that mineral developments demonstrate acceptable levels of vibration [22, 23]. The assessment’s **reliance on limited data, lack of a clear plan for mitigation monitoring, and insufficient assessment of air overpressure may not fully demonstrate acceptable levels of vibration**, therefore potentially violating this policy.

### Objections Local Residents Can Use

Based on the analysis, here are some objections local residents could raise in letters to the planning department:

*   **Inadequate Baseline Vibration Data:** The vibration assessment relies on a limited amount of monitoring data and does not fully integrate routine monitoring data.
*   **Unverified Regression Analysis:** The site specific regression analysis is not shown or verifiable.
*   **Lack of Air Overpressure Assessment:** The assessment does not adequately assess the potential impact of air overpressure from blasting, despite acknowledging the possibility for nuisance and human perception issues.
*   **Subjectivity of Vibration Perception:** The assessment does not adequately consider or mitigate for the subjective nature of human perception of vibration.
*   **Insufficient Gas Pipeline Safety Analysis:** The assessment does not include a full and thorough analysis of the safety of the gas pipeline.
*   **Lack of Cumulative Impact Consideration:** The assessment fails to consider the cumulative impact of vibration from other sources in the area, such as the Lost Shore Surf Resort, or other blasting operations which might be started in the future.
*   **Inadequate Mitigation Monitoring:** The assessment lacks a clear plan for monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation measures and a process for modifying or improving those measures if monitoring suggests they are not sufficient.
*  **Lack of a Monitoring Plan:** The report lacks a plan for monitoring and incorporating that data into future blasting design plans.
*   **Policy Non-Compliance:** The vibration assessment does not sufficiently demonstrate compliance with City Plan 2030 policies on amenity and pollution and the NPF4 policy on acceptable levels of vibration.

By raising these specific, evidence-based objections, residents can make a stronger case against the quarry expansion.
