## Report on Bonnington Mains Quarry Expansion

This report examines the planning application for the Bonnington Mains Quarry, focusing on potential breaches of the City Plan 2030 and the National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4). The application, submitted by Breedon Trading Ltd and Brewster Brothers Ltd, seeks permission for a lateral extension to the quarry, the erection of a Materials Recycling Plant (MRP), infilling of the quarry, and restoration to agricultural grassland [1-4].

### Overview of the Proposed Development

The proposal involves several key components [1]:

*   **Lateral Quarry Extension:** Expanding the quarry in a south-westerly direction [1, 5]. The site area extends to 28 hectares [6].
*   **Materials Recycling Plant (MRP):** A new facility to process waste into recycled aggregates and a residual clay/silt material [1, 4, 5, 7, 8].
*  **Infilling:**  Using the residual material from the MRP to infill the quarry void [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]. The infilling operation will be carried out under the terms of a Waste Management Licence (WML) or WML exemption [9, 10].
*   **Restoration:** Returning the site to agricultural grassland [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]. Completion of extraction and infilling is planned for September 3, 2050, with restoration by September 3, 2052 [2].

### Policy Context

The applicants argue that the proposal is supported by Policy Inf 20 of the Edinburgh City Plan 2030, which backs mineral extraction, and Policy Inf 18, which supports waste management facilities within operational quarries [1]. They also claim alignment with NPF4 [11]. The City Plan 2030 aims to guide development and investment choices, providing a basis for planning decisions [12-14].

### Potential Breaches and Policy Violations

Despite the applicant's claims of alignment with planning policies, there are several areas where the proposal may breach or be in danger of violating the City Plan 2030 and NPF4.

#### City Plan 2030

*   **Policy Env 18 - Development in the Green Belt and Countryside:** This policy requires development not to detract from the rural environment or landscape quality [15]. The quarry extension, despite claims of limited impact, may alter the character and views of the countryside, especially with the new MRP [15, 16].
*   **Policy Env 33 - Amenity:** This policy seeks to protect the amenity of neighboring properties regarding noise [17]. The extended operations, including the MRP and blasting, could lead to significant noise issues [17, 18]. The existing quarry is already considered a noise-sensitive receptor [19].
*   **Policy Env 34 - Pollution and Air, Water, and Soil Quality:** This policy aims to prevent adverse effects on soil quality [20]. The infilling and MRP operations could risk soil and water quality if not managed correctly [21]. It also seeks to protect air quality. The operation of the MRP, as well as increased traffic, may impact air quality [22-24].
*   **Policy Env 35 - Reducing Flood Risk:** This policy states that development should not increase flood risk [21]. While the application includes a drainage strategy, the increased dewatering and scale of the development could increase flood risk [25, 26].
*   **Policy Env 36 - Designing for Surface Water:** This policy promotes sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) and discourages surface water connections to combined sewers [21, 26]. The application intends to use SUDS, but the effectiveness needs to be ensured [21].
*   **Policy Inf 4 - Provision of Transport Infrastructure:** This policy requires proposals that generate significant traffic to demonstrate adequate transport infrastructure [27]. While the application claims no change in permitted quarry output, the socio-economic assessment indicates that the site will provide a significant contribution to aggregates supply in the local area, implying peak traffic levels will be maintained [27, 28]. This may require a transport assessment to assess the impact of maintaining peak traffic levels.
*   **Policy Inf 20 - Minerals:** While supporting mineral extraction, this policy is contingent on meeting other environmental protection policies. Breaches of policies protecting amenity and the environment will also violate this policy [29-32].

#### National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4)

*   **Policy 3 - Biodiversity:** NPF4 requires developments to enhance biodiversity [33, 34]. Initial habitat loss from the quarry extension may lead to a biodiversity deficit if not mitigated properly [34]. The site is known to have Great Crested Newts, which require protection [35, 36].
*   **Policy 12 - Zero Waste:** This policy addresses waste infrastructure, requiring an assessment of noise impact [18, 37, 38]. The MRP is likely to increase noise, necessitating further consideration of this impact [37].
*   **Policy 22 - Flood Risk and Water Management:** This policy aims to prevent increased flood risk and ensure proper water management [33, 39]. The increased dewatering rate and scale of the development could pose a flood risk [33, 39-41].
*   **Policy 33 - Minerals:** While supporting mineral extraction, this policy also requires acceptable impacts on noise, dust, vibration, and pollution [21, 42]. Breaches of other policies regarding these impacts will also breach Policy 33 [21, 42].
*    **Transport Assessment:** NPF4 requires a transport assessment if a proposal will generate a significant increase in person trips, or increase reliance on the private car [43]. The application has not demonstrated that maintaining peak traffic levels will not have an adverse impact, and a transport assessment may be required [27].

### Detailed Objections for Local Residents

Here are detailed objections that local residents can use in letters to the planning department, citing the relevant policies:


## Objections to Bonnington Mains Quarry Expansion

As a local resident, I am writing to object to the proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry. This development poses significant risks to our community and the environment, and it contravenes several policies within the City Plan 2030 and the National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4).

### Specific Objections:

*   **Landscape and Visual Impact:** The quarry extension and the Materials Recycling Plant (MRP) will negatively impact the rural environment and landscape character, contravening City Plan 2030, Policy Env 18, and NPF4 policy 3 which seeks to enhance biodiversity [15, 16].
*   **Noise Pollution:** The proposed expansion, including the MRP, will likely increase noise levels, impacting the amenity of nearby residents. This is in violation of City Plan 2030, Policy Env 33, and NPF4, Policy 12 d) which requires a noise impact assessment for waste infrastructure [17, 18].
*   **Air Quality:** The operation of the MRP and increased vehicle movements may worsen air quality, contravening City Plan 2030, Policy Env 34, and NPF4 policy 33 d) iv) which requires mineral extraction to have acceptable pollution levels [22-24].
*   **Water and Soil Quality:** The infilling process and MRP operations could pollute soil and water, violating City Plan 2030, Policy Env 34, and NPF4 Policy 33 d) iv) [21, 26]. The increased discharge rate from dewatering may also negatively impact the environment [26, 40, 41].
*   **Flood Risk:** The increased dewatering rate and scale of the development could lead to increased flood risk, contravening City Plan 2030, Policy Env 35, and NPF4 Policy 22 [21, 26].
*   **Transport:** The application states that there is no proposed change to traffic levels, however the socio-economic impact statement suggests that the development will support a significant aggregate supply in the local area, implying that peak traffic levels are to be maintained. The application has not provided sufficient evidence to confirm there will be no adverse impact on local roads. This contravenes City Plan 2030 Policy Inf 4, and NPF4 which requires a transport assessment for proposals which will generate a significant increase in person trips or which would increase reliance on the private car [27, 28].
*   **Biodiversity:** Initial habitat loss from the quarry extension is not adequately addressed to ensure replacement or enhancement, violating NPF4, Policy 3 [33-36].
*   **Cumulative Effects:** The application fails to adequately assess the cumulative effects of this development in combination with other developments, which is a requirement of both NPF4 and the planning department [44, 45].

### Conclusion

The proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry poses significant threats to our local environment and community. I urge the City of Edinburgh Council to reject this application due to these clear breaches of policy and the detrimental impact it will have. The application does not adequately address the impact of the development on the community.

Thank you for considering my objection.
