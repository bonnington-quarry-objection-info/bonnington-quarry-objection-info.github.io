## Critique of Bonnington Mains Quarry Dust Assessment



The dust and air quality assessment for the proposed Bonnington Mains Quarry extension concludes that the development will have **negligible effects on local air quality** and that adverse dust impacts from hard rock quarries are uncommon beyond 400m from dust-generating activities [1]. The assessment uses a source-pathway-receptor model, and suggests that with dust control measures like water sprays and speed limits, the impact will be minimal [1]. However, a closer examination reveals several inadequacies in the approach and assumptions made in the report.



### Wind Data Analysis



The dust assessment relies heavily on wind data to predict dust events. It notes that winds under 5.6 m/s (11 knots) are unlikely to carry dust [1]. It includes a table summarizing dry, windy days and their directions [1]. However, the analysis **only looks at the frequency of winds above 5.6 m/s and dry days, ignoring the duration of these winds and the potential for gusting** [1]. The report references an annual frequency analysis of wind speed and direction but does not fully integrate this data into the assessment [1]. This data seems to indicate that prevailing winds from the west southwest will be the most impactful but the report states that "a dust event will only occur if the necessary conditions are present" [1]. The report appears to assume that because not all operations are dusty because of the lack of physical disturbance, that this makes the dust risk negligible, this assumption is not proven and may not always be accurate [1]. **This incomplete analysis does not sufficiently account for the potential of dust dispersal**, especially with variable wind conditions [1].



### Inadequate Receptor Consideration



The assessment claims that ecological receptors are not considered further because they are more than 400 meters from the future working area [1]. While based on a conservative distance given in IAQM guidance, this approach may not account for the **potential impact of dust on sensitive ecological sites**, areas of protected habitat, or species, particularly when combined with other factors. The report uses a low risk categorization for most receptors and does not fully account for an individual's sensitivity to dust, stating that "the point at which an individual makes a complaint is highly subjective" [1]. **The analysis does not provide adequate consideration of all potential impacts on all receptors**, including sensitive ecological areas.



### PM10 and PM2.5 Assessment



The report states that quarrying and construction account for less than 1 µgm-³ of the annual mean concentration of PM10 across the UK [1]. While the report acknowledges the DETR (Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions) publication for assessing PM10 particulates, it **does not fully address potential health impacts**, particularly for more sensitive individuals [1]. The report assumes a 1µgm-³ site attributable load of PM10 without clearly demonstrating that this is an appropriate value for this specific site or how this value was calculated [1]. The report also uses a ratio of PM2.5/PM10 of 0.7 to estimate PM2.5 burden, which is considered a worst case, but **this is not directly measured at the site** and does not account for site-specific conditions [1].



### Subjectivity of Dust Nuisance



The report acknowledges that the point at which an individual makes a complaint is highly subjective [1]. **This highlights a gap in the assessment, as it doesn't fully account for individual sensitivities to dust**.



### Cumulative Impacts



The report identifies the need to consider cumulative effects but the dust assessment appears to consider the impact from this site in isolation [1]. It **does not take into account other potential sources of dust** in the area such as the indoor waste recycling center granted planning permission nearby or construction from the Lost Shore Surf Resort.



### Mitigation Measures



While the report states that dust suppression measures would be effective, it **does not provide a system for evaluating their effectiveness**, or a plan for how to make changes when dust problems are identified [1].



## Potential Policy Violations



### City Plan 2030



The City Plan 2030 emphasizes that development should not harm air quality or create new AQMAs [2]. It also stresses the need to consider cumulative impacts [2]. The dust assessment’s reliance on a generalized 1µgm-³ PM10 load and a generic PM2.5 ratio, **combined with an incomplete analysis of wind patterns, does not sufficiently demonstrate compliance with these policies**. The plan also indicates that "appropriate siting of buildings and uses on site as well as retaining and providing green/blue infrastructure within developments should be the first options explored to address the adverse effects noted in this policy"[3]. The report makes no mention of this principle [1].



### National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4)



NPF4 requires development proposals to demonstrate acceptable levels of pollution [4]. The framework also emphasizes the need to minimize lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change risks [4]. The dust assessment’s limited analysis of local wind conditions and potential dust dispersion, together with a generalized approach to estimating PM10 and PM2.5 impacts, **may not demonstrate acceptable levels of pollution in all circumstances, and does not demonstrate a sufficient approach to climate change risk**.



## Objections Local Residents Can Use



Based on the analysis, here are some objections local residents could raise in letters to the planning department:



*   **Insufficient Wind Analysis:** The dust assessment does not adequately analyze the local wind patterns, particularly the duration of winds above 5.6 m/s, or the potential for gusts to carry dust further than predicted [1].

*  **Inadequate Consideration of Receptors:** The assessment does not properly consider the impact of dust on sensitive ecological areas and assumes that all receptors more than 400m from the quarry are at low risk of dust impact [1].

*   **Unsubstantiated PM10 and PM2.5 Loadings:** The assessment relies on a generalized 1µgm-³ PM10 loading, which is not specific to the site or calculated based on site-specific data and also uses a ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 of 0.7, also not based on site-specific data [1].

*   **Lack of Cumulative Impact Consideration:** The assessment does not adequately consider the cumulative impact of dust from other sources in the area, including the nearby waste recycling center and the Lost Shore Surf Resort [1].

*   **Subjectivity of Dust Complaints:** The dust assessment acknowledges the subjectivity of dust complaints and therefore does not provide adequate mitigations for individual sensitivities to dust [1].

*   **Inadequate Mitigation Monitoring:** The report lacks a clear methodology for monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation measures and does not define a system for making changes or improvements [1].

*   **Policy Non-Compliance:** The dust assessment does not demonstrate compliance with the City Plan 2030 or the National Planning Framework 4 by failing to fully consider local air quality, cumulative impacts, or the specific requirements for developments which may impact air quality [2, 4].

*  **Lack of Green Infrastructure:** The dust assessment and the plans for the quarry make no mention of green or blue infrastructure being used to mitigate the impact of dust [3].



By raising these specific, evidence-based objections, residents can make a stronger case against the quarry expansion.

> 2.1.2 The view of the working group who contributed to the preparation of the guidance is that it is currently inappropriate to use a quantitative modelling approach to predict the impact in most cases and that a simple approach using the S-P-R concept should usually suffice.
