This post provides an in-depth analysis of the planning application for the proposed expansion of Bonnington Mains Quarry. It draws upon information from the provided [documents](https://citydev-portal.edinburgh.gov.uk/idoxpa-web/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=SNPUZREWGDP00)
to offer a comprehensive understanding of the project, address key concerns, and guide residents in formulating effective objections.

#### Project Overview

**Breedon Trading Limited and Brewster Brothers Limited** have jointly submitted a planning application to extend operations at Bonnington Mains Quarry. The application seeks permission for:

*   A **south-westerly lateral extension** of the existing quarry.
*   The **erection and operation of a Materials Recycling Plant (MRP)** to process incoming waste and produce recycled aggregates.
*   The **infilling of the quarry void** using residual material from the MRP, restoring the land to its approximate original level.
*  The **restoration of the site** to agricultural grassland.

The proposed development site is located at Bonnington Mains Quarry, Cliftonhall Road, Newbridge, Edinburgh, EH28 8PW. The total site area is **28.0 hectares** [1, 2]. The applicants state that the proposal aligns with **Policy Inf 20** (mineral extraction) and **Policy Inf 18** (waste management) of the adopted Edinburgh City Plan 2030 [1]. The application is not for a temporary permission.

#### Pre-Application Consultation

The applicants undertook a pre-application consultation process, including:

*   Submission of a **Proposal of Application Notice (PoAN)** on August 1, 2023 [3, 4].
*   A public consultation webpage launched on July 31, 2023 [5].
*   A letter drop to **281 nearby residential properties** [4].
*   Two public events held at **Ratho Community Centre** on August 28 and October 2, 2023 [4].
*   Public notices in the **Edinburgh Evening News** [4, 6].
*   Various feedback methods including verbal feedback, feedback forms, email and post [7].
*   The PoAN was also sent to the **Pentland Hills Ward Councillors, Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP and Christine Jardine MSP** [3, 8].
*   A **Scoping Opinion** was issued by the City of Edinburgh Council on 9th October 2023 [9, 10].

The City of Edinburgh Council approved the proposed consultation subject to additional consultation with local constituency MP & MSPs and engagement with the local community council in accordance with the Edinburgh Planning Concordat [11].

#### Key Application Details

*   **Planning Fee**: The application fee is **£108,000** [2].
*   **Site Characteristics**: The site is a **hard rock quarry and agricultural land** [9].
*   **Access**: No new or altered vehicle access to or from a public road is proposed [9].
*   **Schedule 3 Development**: The proposal is classified as Schedule 3 development under the Town and Country Planning regulations [12].

#### Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been conducted to assess the likely environmental effects of the proposal [13]. The EIA report comprises multiple volumes:

*   **Volume 1**: Written Statement [14].
*   **Volume 2**: Figures.
*   **Volume 3**: Appendices.
*   **Volume 4**: Non-Technical Summary (NTS) [15].

The EIA process includes assessments of:

*   Landscape and Visual Impact [16].
*   Ecology [17].
*   Water Environment [18].
*   Noise [19].
*   Dust and Air Quality [20].
*   Vibration [21].
*   Archaeology and Cultural Heritage [22].
*   Traffic and Transport [23].

The EIA report was informed by a scoping opinion received from the City of Edinburgh Council [10].

Copies of the full Environmental Statement can be obtained for a fee of £275 (paper copy) or £25 (USB) [15].

#### Key Concerns and Potential Issues

Several concerns and potential issues have emerged from the provided documents that residents should consider when objecting to the application:

1.  **Visual Impact and Landscape**: The Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) has been carried out [16]. The impact on the rural landscape is a potential concern [24]. The site is located within Landscape Character Type (LCT) 274 Lowland Plain. Residents may argue that the quarry extension will negatively impact the rural landscape. **Policy Env 18** of the City Plan 2030 requires that development in the countryside should not be detrimental to the rural environment [24]. **NPF4 policy 33** states that mineral developments should not cause significant adverse landscape and visual impacts [24-26].
2.  **Environmental Impact**: There is a potential risk of **groundwater contamination** from infilling using residual materials from the MRP [18]. The application also needs to address concerns about **dust and noise** [27]. An air quality assessment has been conducted [20]. **Policy Env 34** of the City Plan 2030 states that planning permission should not be granted if there are significant adverse effects to ground stability [28]. **NPF4 policy 33** requires that mineral extraction must show acceptable levels of noise, dust, vibration and pollution of land, air and water [25, 26].
3.  **Traffic and Transportation**: Although the applicants state that there will be no change in traffic [29], residents may argue that the cumulative impact of the proposed development with other projects like the **Lost Shore Surf Resort** has not been adequately considered. **Policy Inf 4** of the City Plan 2030 requires that developments generating significant traffic must demonstrate that transport infrastructure has been addressed [29]. **NPF4 policy 19** discourages proposals that increase reliance on private car use [26]. A transport assessment should be carried out to assess all potential transport impacts of the proposed development [30].
4.  **Biodiversity**: The impact on local habitats and species, including the **Great Crested Newt**, needs to be addressed [17, 31]. Although the applicants have plans to improve biodiversity, the quarry expansion will cause some damage. An eDNA survey was carried out and no great crested newts were found [32, 33].  **Policy Env 21** of the City Plan 2030 aims to prevent significant adverse effects on the integrity of local habitats [34]. **NPF4 policy 3** requires proposals to enhance biodiversity [35]. The Scottish Government has published a draft strategy for biodiversity, which sets out ambitions for Scotland to be Nature Positive by 2030 and to have restored and regenerated biodiversity across the country by 2045 [17].
5.  **Amenity**: The proposed development may have a negative impact on the amenity of neighboring properties due to **noise and vibration** from blasting [36]. **Policy Env 33** of the City Plan 2030 requires that developments should not negatively impact the amenity of neighboring properties regarding noise [37]. **NPF4 policy 33** demands that noise and vibration levels must be acceptable [26]. A vibration assessment has been undertaken [36].
6.  **Cumulative Impacts**: Both City Plan 2030 and NPF4 require consideration of cumulative impacts [26, 38]. Residents must highlight the combined effect of the quarry expansion and other developments such as the Lost Shore Surf Resort on noise, traffic, and visual amenity.

#### How to Formulate Effective Objections

Residents should focus on the following points to object to the planning application:

*   **Visual Impact:** Argue that the quarry extension will significantly alter the rural landscape, referencing specific viewpoints and the visual impact on residential properties.
*   **Environmental Pollution:** Raise concerns about potential groundwater contamination from the infilling process, demanding detailed analysis of the infill material and its impact on water quality.
*   **Noise and Vibration:** Object to the impact of noise and vibration from increased quarrying and blasting activities, especially in proximity to residential properties.
*   **Traffic and Transportation**: Demand a comprehensive traffic assessment which addresses the cumulative impact of all developments in the area including the Lost Shore Surf Resort.
*   **Biodiversity**: Highlight the potential risk to local habitats and protected species, and demand further ecological surveys.
*   **Amenity:** Emphasize the negative impact on the quality of life for residents due to increased noise, dust, and vibration.
*   **Cumulative Impacts:** The combined impact of this development with other proposed developments in the area should be a key concern.
*   **Lack of Detail:** Point out the application lacks critical details about the infilling process and management of the MRP, demanding a more comprehensive plan on how the recycling plant will work and how the infill material will be managed.

By focusing on these concerns and referring to the relevant policies of the **City Plan 2030** and the **National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4)**, residents can present strong, well-supported objections to the proposed quarry expansion.

It's crucial to remember that comments made during the pre-application consultation are not formal representations to the planning authority [39]. Formal representations can be made once the planning application has been submitted [39]. The planning authority will not determine the application if pre-application consultation requirements have not been met [39]. The applicant must prepare a report outlining the pre-application consultation process, and demonstrate that the public was aware that pre-application consultation does not replace the formal application process [39, 40]. The planning application cannot be submitted less than 12 weeks from the date the Proposal of Application Notice is received [40]. The application was submitted on the 29th November 2024 [1]. The Proposal of Application Notice was received on 1st August 2023 [3, 4].

This detailed analysis provides a solid foundation for residents to effectively object to the proposed Bonnington Mains Quarry expansion.
